**Abstract**: Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has gained attention for its high fidelity and real-time rendering. However, adapting 3DGS to different camera models, particularly fisheye lenses, poses challenges due to the unique 3D to 2D projection calculation. Additionally, there are inefficiencies in the tile-based splatting, especially for the extreme curvature and wide field of view of fisheye lenses, which are crucial for its broader real-life applications. To address these challenges, we introduce Fisheye-GS, a novel method that recalculates the projection transformation for fisheye cameras, and then optimizes the rendering process with the reduced number of overlapped tiles. Our method reduces computational redundancy and memory usage, significantly improving rendering speed and enabling 3DGS to be effectively used with a wider range of camera perspectives. With our optimization, we achieved a maximum rendering efficiency of 570 FPS at a high-definition resolution of 1752 Ã— 1168.

### Hardware Requirements

- CUDA-ready GPU with Compute Capability 7.0+
- 24 GB VRAM (to train to paper evaluation quality)

### Software Requirements
- Conda (recommended for easy setup)
- C++ Compiler for PyTorch extensions (we used Visual Studio 2019 for Windows)
- CUDA SDK 11 for PyTorch extensions, install *after* Visual Studio
- C++ Compiler and CUDA SDK must be compatible

## Setup
```shell
conda env create --file environment.yml
conda activate fisheye_gs
```
## Prepare Training Data on Scannet++ Dataset
Undistort the distortions excluding the radial distortion from $k_1$
```shell
python prepare_scannetpp.py \
    --path <path to your dataset> \
    --src images \
    --dst image_undistorted_fisheye 
```
Or simply use:
```shell
sh scripts/prepare.sh
```
## Training on Scannet++ Dataset
```shell
python train.py \
    -s <path to your dataset> \
    -m <path to model to be trained> \
    --images <relative path to images> \
    --colmaps <relative path to colmap file if using dataset> \
    --bs 3 \
    --ds 1 \
    --fisheye \
    --train_random_background 
```
Or simply use:
```shell
sh scripts/train.sh
```
## Rendering on Scannet++ Dataset
```shell
python render.py \
    -s <path to your dataset> \
    -m <path to model to be trained> \
    --images <relative path to images> \
    --colmaps <relative path to colmap file if using dataset> \
    --skip_train \
    --fisheye \
    --ds 1 \
    -r 1 
```
Or simply use
```shell
sh scripts/render.sh
```
## Evaluating
```shell
python metrics.py \
    -m <path to model to be trained>
```
Or simply use
```shell
sh scripts/eval.sh
```
